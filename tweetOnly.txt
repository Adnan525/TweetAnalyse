anyone   mustards grain worth  faith  his heart would prefer  million times hand over mare (9) 

 to  who implements sharia and rules  islam instead  giving it to  pkk (10) 

they wanted to revolt against bashar and they ended up being slaves to  tawaghit and their puppet agents well done (11) 

 they didnt liberate (12) 

 they didnt lift (13) 

 any siege on anything 

you couldnt find one single one  them ready to sacrifice himself for  sake  allah to defend mare (14)

 but handing it over to  pkk yes? (15)

- shaddadi attack repelled 

- killed hundreds  shias  damascus and homs 

- assad route to aleppo  khanasir cut off 

@apollo_next @ramiallolah not true rebels put themselves into this position by hinging their fate on  uss dictats (then got betrayed)

look   arrows near  bottom isis have cut off assads supply lines to aleppo and weakened  seige  

@warreporter1 i suspect  fsa will repay isis favour by signing  ceasefire  assad and join forces  him against isis 

 although its  fluid situation kurds lost hundreds  men due to their incompetance without us airstrikes 

 assad and russia will eat them up 

@markruffalo dear mark go back to bed it  2016 now  #syria not 2011 

these tweets summarise  limitations   ypg and its inability to extend military control over parts  syria  

 islamic state and jund al-aqsa  co-ordinating  each other to cut off assads supply lines to aleppo

probably  first ever official statement denying death   very high ranking #isis commander they didnt even issue one for baghdadi

 they can guess where shishani really  1/2

@kronykal i hope you dont expect me to be convinced  published polls where answering i support  gets you right to jail

@kronykal it  your narrow point  view that draws you to such conclusions you need to take  step back and consider  general picture 

@kronykal thats your interpretation  what i said im telling you there  no purely objective statistics on  question 

 existing studies  actually deeply subjective and force  non-natural conclusion 

 anything you find there regarding those issues  my opinion 

 what conclusion would you have drawn? there  no isis 

  quran &amp sunna im referring to  still  same as   prophet (pbuh)s time 

 what if  question  asked   11th century? 

@kronykal you support  almoravid rebels who want to establish  death cult dynasty? nonsense your problem isnt isis its islam

#isis statement about #usa strike on #iraq|i army  2 days old both aamaq &amp  reported it today as breaking news

@kasimf قل لي متى قدروا ثوار داريا يمدو راسهم برا داريا شبر واحد وليش القصر الجمهوري ينعم بالسكينة والطمأنينة لخمس سنين متواليات 

@kasimf لو الدولة تريد التحصن بتدمر لفعلت ولتركتها أثر بعد عين كما فعلت في كوباني لكن شو الفائدة من التحصن؟ الحرب صولات وجولات وليست النهاية 

@kasimf على الأقل الدولة عندما تنسحب من مكان تجد أهله يستطيعون الرجوع اليه والحياة فيه من يستطيع العودة والحياة في داريا والخالدية المدمرة؟ 

@kasimf عدد من قتلت الدولة من جيش النظام في محيط تدمر ومثلث خناصر أثريا السلمية يفوق ما قتل ثوار داريا خلال خمس سنين من الرباط في سبيل الله

what happened to  muslims  shaam  this day &amp age should wake up any muslim who has  heart &amp cares about  believers 

 filthy kuffar  paving  way for  mass-murderer (bashar) who  responsible for 95%   deaths that occurred 

their hatred for  religion  allah &amp his sharia   great that they would rather have bashar as  ruler no matter how many muslims die 

#nusra/ ahrar and other rebels offensive on #syrian army positions near strategic #teleiis town  southern #aleppo  

their hatred for  religion  allah   severe that  intervention happened only after  sharia  allah  established 

 kuffar united every single enemy  allah &amp dropped them   cursed coalition to bomb  muslims day &amp night  this not hatred? 

allah says they desire to harm you severly hatred has already appeared from their mouth but wat their breasts conceal  far worse [3118] 

as imam anwar used to say  law  shaytan would tolerate gays &amp lesbians but it will never tolerate  religion  truth

@omashkavash16 yes theres  conflict within nusra between jihadists and nationalists abu firas   jihadist and upset many nationalists

 but  ordered by their backers not to use them on assad

syrian revolution supporters show disgust  rebel groups who sold out  syrian cause for sake  money/politics

@warreporter1 1 this has something to do   alleged internal coup which took place within nusra  few days ago its alleged that 

@warreporter1 2 hardline pro-aq elements  nusra  killed   us airstrike and moderate elements  nusra want to merge  rebels

allaahu akbar 

beautiful words   

@jooniisrar it  obvious since last year that there   moderate faction  nusra who wanted to leave aq to gain favor   west 

@jooniisrar abu firas al-suri  one  those hardliners who stood   way   moderates who wanted to leave al-qaeda seems his 

notice  trend 

qatar - aljazeera - taliban - alqaeda - @charles_lister 

 sahwat al sham will end up   national unity government  assad to fight  caliphat… 

@jooniisrar death  too convenient to be  coincidence and now rumours say jawlani  dead too i think moderate faction  doing this 

they said islamic state  uneducated stupid unwilling to cooperate 

no we saw through all  lies and empty words and stick on beards 

alqaeda fan boys 

war  deception 

we can ally  us to deceive everyone 

and then buy weapons get strong then fight then 

saudi tried that 

 its bad but it can be cleaned later inshallah  

true 

sahawat couldnt even continue fighting asad 

signed  truce  him 

sold their religion to us 

no perseverance  

@jooniisrar only rumours saying he died   airstrike on  building near idlib wont be surprised if his allies sold him out  return 

alqaeda logic 

fighting under us makes you  mujahid 

fighting solely for allah independently makes you khawarij  

@jooniisrar for  power being offered to rebels during  peace process nusra should have known that their allies  unreliable 

okay there  no need to mention alqaeda separately from sahawat alridda anymore 

  use sahawat alridda for alqaeda often 

@jooniisrar i think isis warned nusra that nusra should not to be allies   rebels due to their corrupt ideology (manhaj+aqidah)

@vivarevolt and isis  to be blamed right? 

former hamas commander ahmad abo hussein from gaza-palestine  killed  clashes  #saa  south #aleppo  

#is recaptured al-raii town and 10 villages from #rebels  north #aleppo 

@vivarevolt hahahahaha that   good one i guess isis should consult their offensives  turkey and saudi next time 

@salim_abu_aicha  way things  playing out isis will be seen as only viable anti-assad force fsa/ahrar made big blunder  ceasefire 

it appears that  us-funded syrian rebels who took al-rai from isis under us and turkish orders died  vain as isis now control al-rai 

famous arab journalist wael essam harshly criticises fsa and ahrar as-sham for fighting and dying under us orders  

isis supporters remind syrian rebels  abu muhammad al-adnanis words about how  west will use and abuse them  

@xanasore he seems to have deleted it what exactly did he say?

@ja4b_ dear would you  change your profile photo? it  confusing others  my account please? thank you 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar كلام جميل أظن إردوغان يتحسس خطر معين فيريد ترتيبات معينة لمرحلة قادمة لأني لا أرى بصراحة مبرر للإستقالة حاليا 

@free_sham88 @vfdg5y5r بخير الله يرضى عليك 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar بالفعل لكن أردوغان بنظري دكتاتور بغض النظر عن انجازاته وعنده نرجسية عالية جدا وأظن داود أوغلو براغماتي أكثر منه 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar والغرب يرى فيه محاور جيد عنده ثوابت لكن ليس عنيد وراسه يابس مثل أردوغان يحسب لأوغلو قضية التفاوض مع أوروبا من 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar اجل اللاجئين والحكومات الأوروبية وميركل ترتاح لأوغلو أكثر من أردوغان بكثير 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar اذا استقال أوغلو بالفعل فاعتبر أردوغان وحزبه بحكم الساقط سياسيا وربما هذا مايريده الغرب لا أعرف اذا أوغلو سيترك 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar الحزب أيضا بس أظن هذا لن يحدث إلا اذا حدث انقلاب داخل الحزب على أردوغان وأظنه قريب 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar البراغماتية مطلوبة خصوصا مع الغرب في قضايا المصالح الصوت العالي والغضب والنرجسية ما تنفع في سياسة المصالح 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar أردوغان لن يجد بديل مناسب عن أوغلو للتخاطب مع الغرب وإيران تحديدا أظن أيام عزلته الدولية باتت قريبة 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar خذ مثال قضية السفينة الاسرائيلية أردوغان يريد بعنترية ابقاءها مفتوحة للأبد منشان مصالح سمعوية في العالم الاسلامي 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar أوغلو يريد كسب مصالح منها وتحريكها وبالفعل القضية تحركت وهناك بوادر على انهاءها لكن نرجسية أردوغان تأبى انه يفعلها 

@ww3iskoming @mousaalomar أتمنى أن تركيا لا تنزلق لبوادر انقسام سياسي لأن الغرب جاهز بالبديل وهم الأكراد والمعارضة وساعتها الله يرحم الجميع

5 or  ayman zawahiri simply ignorant about  nature   syrian rebels he calls nusra to merge  and thus guilty  being naive?
